Good afternoon Mr. Bob Williams.
I see you are feeling a little weak today but managing. 
I'm here to go over some information for your admission form and I'll start by gathering some information. 
Today's admission date is October 28th, 2024.
You were transported here by ambulance and your wife accompanied you. 
I'll note that. Now, let's review your diagnoses. 
You've shared that you have diabetes and high blood pressure, I'll record that in your chart. 
Next, I'll check your vitals. Your temperature is 99.1. Heartbeat is 78. Respiration is 18 breaths per minute and your blood pressure is 140 on 100, and O2 saturation is 99%.
Your weight is 180 pounds and your height is 68 inches. 
You've mentioned that you're allergic to sulfa drugs, so I'll make sure to note that as well. 
Moving on to your skin assessment. You've said there are no issues. And from my check, your skin does appear a bit dry but warm. 
There's no redness or other visible concerns, which is good. 
Now, let's talk about your physical status. Your breathing seems fine with no issues and you have no paralysis or contractures. 
I'll also make a note that you wear glasses and have dentures for both your upper and lower teeth. 
Regarding mobility, you mentioned that you can transfer from bed or a chair, though you may need a little help from your wife, so I'll record that and contact guard assistance. 
You're able to walk on your own, but you use a cane for support. It's great that you're able to bear full weight on both sides. And there's no need for additional supportive devices like elastic hose or an air mattress. 
Let's move on to your sensory abilities. Your hearing is good, and with your glasses, your vision is also fine. That's all noted. 
Now, in terms of eating, you're able to eat independently, and you don't need any adaptive equipment for that. For hygiene, I'll note that you need some assistance with showering but can brush your teeth and shave on your own. You also mentioned that you need help with dressing, so I'll make a note of that. 
Next, we'll review your bowel and bladder habits. You've confirmed that you're continent of both bowel and bladder, and you don't use a catheter. 
There are no issues with constipation or laxatives, which is good to hear. 
Let's talk about your psychosocial aspects. You've shared that you have a close relationship with your wife, who is your main caregiver. I'll note that you describe yourself as alert and friendly, and your mood seems to be okay overall, though you sometimes feel homesick and worried about your health, which is understandable. 
Lastly, I'll confirm that you're not a smoker and don't use alcohol. So that's all said. 
Now, I'll review your orientation to the facility. You've been shown around and know how to use the call lights, and you're aware of the visiting hours, meal times, and facility rules. 
That concludes our assessment Mr. Williams, thank you for answering all the questions. I'll make sure your care plan is updated accordingly.
