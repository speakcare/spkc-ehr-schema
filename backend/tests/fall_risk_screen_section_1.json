Calculate this score by adding the points from all questions responses in this response. \nThe number of points for an answer is provided at the end of the answer string in parenthesis  for example: (1 point) or (4 points)\n\nFor Single selection fields you should take the number of points from the single answer. For example:  \n\"Decreased muscular coordination/jerking movements (1 point)\" - in this case count 1 point.\nor \"TAKES 3-4 of these medications currently and/or within last 7 days (4 points)\" - in this case count 4 points.\n\nFor Multiple select fields there may be more than one response value in a list, you need to take the points from all the responses you provided. For example: \n\"GAIT/BALANCE/AMBULATION\": [\n                    \"Balance problem while standing/walking (1 point)\",\n                    \"Decreased muscular coordination/jerking movements (1 point)\",\n                    \"Requires use of assistive devices (1 point)\"\n                ], \n\nAdd the points from all three responses in the list. In this case there are 3 responses in the list, all of them have (1 point) so they account for 3 points together. \n\nFor Checkbox fields, if the field name has points in it, account for these points only if, and only if, the field is checked (the value is true). \n\nIf the answer string for a certain question does not include points, then add 0 for that answer.\n\nCalculations steps:\n1. For each field in the response, if the question answer string includes point, list the numeric value of the points. \n2. If it is a Multiple select field, list the numeric value of all the answers in the multiple answers list.\n3. If it is a checkbox, list the numeric value of points from the field name, if exists.\n4. Take all the numeric values you listed and create an addition formula, for example: Total score = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 where each addend is the number of points extracted from a question answer string, or from the question string itself (for checkboxes). \n5. To avoid mistakes, break the addition formula into single steps addition where each step is addition of only 2 numbers. For example if: Total score = 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 do:\n4+2 = 6\n6+2=8\n8+2=10\n10+1=11\n11+1=12\n12+1=13\n13+2=15\nTotal score = 15\n6. After calculating the sum of all points, verify that the resulting sum really equals the total.\n\nRespond with the addition result. \n\n"
