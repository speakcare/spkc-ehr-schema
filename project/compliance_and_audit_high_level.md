### **Compliance and Audit Framework Design**

The **Compliance and Audit Framework** is a critical component to ensure that the SpeakCare system adheres to HIPAA, organizational policies, and legal standards. It acts as a safeguard by auditing and sanitizing data at every stage of the pipeline while maintaining traceability for regulatory compliance.

---

## **1. Goals of the Compliance and Audit Framework**
1. **Ensure HIPAA Compliance**:
   - Prevent unintentional exposure or storage of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
2. **Data Minimization**:
   - Replace sensitive information with non-identifiable placeholders during processing while retaining context for downstream systems.
3. **Audit Readiness**:
   - Maintain logs and audit trails of data flow and transformations for external regulatory inspections.
4. **Multi-Tenancy Security**:
   - Isolate customer data and enforce role-based access to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage.
5. **Error Detection**:
   - Automatically flag anomalies, such as unstructured text containing PII where it shouldn't.

---

## **2. Compliance Workflow**
The framework operates in parallel with the data pipeline, ensuring that data entering or exiting each stage is sanitized, validated, and logged.

### **2.1 Data Processing Steps**

#### **Step 1: PII Detection and Redaction**
- **Purpose**:
  - Detect and replace sensitive information such as patient names, birth dates, and medical record numbers in unstructured text.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) models (e.g., spaCy) to identify PHI/PII entities.
  - Replace detected entities with standardized placeholders (e.g., `<patient-name>`, `<dob>`).
- **Example**:
  - Input: "Patient John Doe is experiencing severe pain."
  - Output: "Patient `<patient-name>` is experiencing severe pain."

#### **Step 2: Compliance Validation**
- **Purpose**:
  - Validate that the processed text complies with:
    - HIPAA standards (no unintentional PHI storage).
    - Organizational documentation guidelines (e.g., style and format).
- **Implementation**:
  - Apply a set of validation rules to the processed data.
  - Example rules:
    - Verify that placeholders replace all instances of PHI/PII.
    - Check adherence to organizational jargon and format.

#### **Step 3: Access Control Enforcement**
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce user-specific permissions.
  - Log all access attempts for compliance monitoring.

#### **Step 4: Audit Logging**
- **Purpose**:
  - Maintain a complete, immutable record of data transformations and accesses for regulatory audits.
- **Implementation**:
  - Logs include:
    - Timestamp of data entry and exit at each stage.
    - Transformation details (e.g., redaction operations).
    - User actions (e.g., who accessed what data and when).

#### **Step 5: Post-Processing Data Re-Injection**
- **Purpose**:
  - Reinject redacted PHI/PII into placeholders only where explicitly needed (e.g., before EHR submission).
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a mapping table or tokenization mechanism to securely store and reinject sensitive data for specific outputs.

## **3. Key Features**

### **3.1 PII Entity Recognition**
- **Techniques**:
  - Use pre-trained NLP models (e.g., spaCy, BERT) to identify:
    - Names, addresses, phone numbers.
    - Medical record numbers and insurance IDs.
    - Other sensitive terms (e.g., diagnosis details).
- **Customization**:
  - Extend models with customer-specific dictionaries (e.g., organizational jargon).

---

### **3.2 Data Transformation and Redaction**
- **Rules**:
  - Replace sensitive entities with generic placeholders.
  - Example:
    - "John Doe is 56 years old" â†’ "Patient `<patient-name>` is `<age>` years old."
- **Dynamic Replacement**:
  - Context-sensitive replacements to retain document readability and usability.

---

### **3.3 Logging and Monitoring**
- **Content Auditing**:
  - Log before-and-after snapshots of processed text for traceability.
- **Access Logs**:
  - Capture:
    - User identity.
    - Access time.
    - Access location (e.g., internal system vs. external user).

---

### **3.4 Anomaly Detection**
- **Purpose**:
  - Detect anomalies such as:
    - Sensitive data leaking into incorrect contexts.
    - Data mismatches or processing errors.
- **Techniques**:
  - Use rule-based and ML models to identify anomalies in unstructured text.

---

## **4. Integration Points**

### **4.1 Data Pipeline**
- **Input**: Text data entering or exiting key stages such as Patient Attribution, Sentiment Analysis, and Documentation Preparation.
- **Output**: Sanitized and validated data, free of identifiable information.

### **4.2 EHR Integration**
- Replace placeholders with actual PHI/PII securely before submission to the EHR API.

---

## **5. Tools and Technologies**
- **NLP Libraries**:
  - spaCy for PII detection.
  - Hugging Face Transformers for advanced text processing.
- **Audit Log Management**:
  - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
  - AWS CloudTrail or similar solutions for immutable logging.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - AWS Cognito, Okta, or custom IAM solutions.
- **Tokenization/Mapping**:
  - Secure tokenization libraries for placeholder-to-data mapping.

---

## **6. Scalability and Multi-Tenancy**
- Use tenant-specific rules and configurations for organizations with unique compliance requirements.
- Ensure data segregation and tenant-specific audit trails for multi-tenant deployments.
