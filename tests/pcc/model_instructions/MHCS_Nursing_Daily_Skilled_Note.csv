Key,Actual Question,Where to Extract,Where in Database,Guidelines,Question Change
A_1,Vital signs obtained and reviewed,Audio or Database,Patient Banner,"Mark ""obtained and reviewed"" if nurse mentions checking vitals in audio; if not mentioned in audio, check if vitals are documented in PCC during the same shift.",
B_1,Delirium signs/symptoms (Select all that apply),Audio AND Database AND Assumptions,Med Diag,"CRITICAL: Delirium requires ACUTE CHANGE FROM BASELINE. Look for phrases: ""more confused than usual,"" ""new confusion,"" ""change in mental status,"" ""different from yesterday."" Extract mental status observations from audio AND compare with baseline cognitive function from database. Only select delirium signs if acute change from baseline is clearly indicated. Default to ""No delirium signs and symptoms present"" unless clear acute changes noted.",
B_2,Level of Consciousness,Audio Or Assumption,N/A,"Extract level of consciousness if explicitly mentioned in audio; if not explicitly assessed, infer from interaction patterns: normal conversation and appropriate responses (alert/awake), mentions of sleepiness or sluggish responses (lethargic/drowsy), requires physical stimulation to respond (opens eyes to touch), minimal responsiveness (opens eyes to pain), no response (comatose). Default to ""Alert/awake"" only if normal interactions clearly described. Be conservative - altered LOC is clinically significant, so leave blank if unclear.",
