8_U2_1,Elopement risk score calculation,Audio Or Assumption,N/A,"Score elopement risk using information from admission assessment. Calculate total risk score. If formal elopement screen not completed, score conservatively based on available observations. Calculate total score: 0-9 (not at risk), 10-14 (at risk - requires picture in elopement book and wanderguard if available), 15+ (high risk - requires all interventions plus DON notification for interdisciplinary review). Score based on documented evidence rather than assumptions about potential behaviors."
8_U2_2,Elopement risk level determination,Audio Or Assumption,N/A,"Score elopement risk using information from admission assessment. Calculate total risk score. If formal elopement screen not completed, score conservatively based on available observations. Based on calculated elopement risk score: 0-9 points (not at risk - no interventions needed), 10-14 points (at risk - place picture in elopement book, apply wanderguard if available), 15+ points (high risk - place picture in elopement book, apply wanderguard if available, notify DON for interdisciplinary review)."
8_U3_1,Appropriate interventions status,Audio Or Assumption,N/A,"Score elopement risk using information from admission assessment. Calculate total risk score. If formal elopement screen not completed, score conservatively based on available observations.
