Key,Actual Question,Where to Extract,Where in Database,Guidelines
,,,,"Extract from audio first (nurse conducting the assessment). If not captured in audio or unclear, check PCC database notes with different hierarchies depending on question type. For prior function questions (01A-01D, 02A-02Z), prioritize nursing admission note as it documents baseline before current illness. For current function questions (03A onwards), prioritize PT notes for mobility tasks and OT notes for self-care tasks, then skilled nursing daily notes, then nursing admission note. When sources conflict on current functional performance, defer to OT notes for ADLs (eating, dressing, bathing, hygiene) and PT notes for mobility (transfers, walking, stairs, bed mobility). Leave blank if information is not discussed or truly unknown.
